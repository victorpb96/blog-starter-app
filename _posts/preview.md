True sanity comes from one person's ability to move in a clear direction in life, whether that be in a positive light or a dark direction, we shouldn’t jump from being good to bad and vice versa, we have to choose what sort of person we want to become and how we will live and experience this life. Choices play a key role in a person's ability to think with clarity, which is also built upon mental strength and resilience, we have to learn to make quick decisions at times that can impact how the rest of our lives will flow and develop as we make it onto the later part of our lives.

A Large portion of the population walk through life not being totally awake, they go to their jobs and commit to the daily grind so they can afford the things in life they want, deriving happiness from the act of spending which in reality is an illusion to being happy, we actually have the ability to allow happiness to come from within, we can train our minds to be happy, but it takes time and discipline to achieve this, as you evolve you realise there are free things you can do in life that’ll bring happiness to your lives.

Greed creates even larger gaps between the rich and the poor, as the rich suck up all the resources in order to fulfill their thirst for the best of everything and more, when in reality there’s enough resources on Earth for everyone to live a healthy life, but the system is becoming broken and won’t change anytime soon unless people acknowledge this and do something to change how wealth is distributed amongst people.
