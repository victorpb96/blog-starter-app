excerpt: 'We use our freedom of will to reach out into new areas of thought, as not all knowledge comes from books, we can philosophise about our world and the world around us, and we can change the way we think by starting inside the mind and developing mental strength to change our pain and suffering into happiness.'

What I’ve learnt going through life is that there are defining moments in life, a path that heads in one direction, and another in the opposite direction, we all have to learn to make decisions crucial to whether we reach success or failure. We have to train our minds to tackle these opportunities, which comes with time we learn through experience and this comes through ways of reading, meeting people and learning how people work, no two people are the same, and as you explore the world you soon realise how society is divided up against the rich and the poor, but not everyone has to be broke forever, reading will train the mind to tackle situations as you’ve never before, but this takes time and effort to do.

We use our freedom of will to reach out into new areas of thought, as not all knowledge comes from books, we can philosophise about our world and the world around us, and we can change the way we think by starting inside the mind and developing mental strength to change our pain and suffering into happiness. We can achieve things we never thought we could before, but you have to visualise whatever it is you want in life first to come true, as thoughts manifest which turn into your reality.

Your mind body and soul work together in harmony, so it’s important to work on all three, the soul and the mind are specially linked together, the soul absorbs information that passes through the eyes of a person, and the mind is where we use our cognition to process this information and rationalise this information, at the same time your soul uses this information on its journey through this lifetime to help you make better decisions.
